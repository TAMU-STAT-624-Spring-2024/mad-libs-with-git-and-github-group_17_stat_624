Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Hemanth,

I am writing to you from a intelligent spaceship in a Charismatic galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a Pink rocket in June. There are 25 zebras and lions of tree here! In the
slytherin there is a pool full of coffee. I fall asleep each night on a fantastic bed of
carbon fibre and dream of driving fast. It feels as though I have lived here for
7 [17]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[18] on a [19] [20]!!

Best wishes,
[21]
